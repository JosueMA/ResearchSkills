# A crash course in data visualization and analysis with R
R is the ne plus ultra of statistics software in ecology. For you, there is no getting around learning (at least) basic statistical analysis with R.
For this matter, we provide a stats practical with the objective to make you familiar with basic operations in R, such as 

* load data into R
* do some basic plotting
* do some basic staistical analysis
* ...

and a graphics with R practical to show you basic plotting commands.

## Software to install

* [R](https://cran.r-project.org/)
* [R Studio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)


## Script 

This [script](https://github.com/florianhartig/ResearchSkills/blob/master/Labs/Statistics/Script/EssentialStatistics.pdf) provides a statistics crash course with links to the implementation in R.
It is not meant to replace a proper introductory text-book. For beginners, we recommend Dormann (2013) for German
speakers (ebook free of charge for students from Freiburg, contact Florian) and Gotelli and Ellison (2004) for English speakers. 
Also, see the stats help website of our department [here](http://biometry.github.io/APES/).
