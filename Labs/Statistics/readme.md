#### Lecture notes

* The **[RS statistics lecture notes](https://www.dropbox.com/s/8fmh10fdn6jd2xb/EssentialStatistics.pdf?dl=0)** provides an introduction to the topics of statistics and data analysis


#### Practicals

* [Statistical Analysis](https://github.com/florianhartig/ResearchSkills/blob/master/Labs/Statistics/Practicals/StatisticalAnalysisInR/Statistics.md)

For the course, I will make zipped versions of this practicals, together with source code, data and scripts, avaiable on ILIAS.
