# Project organization

Keeping your project structured will simplify your work greatly. This especially applies to your folder structure.
Here, we give an example of how the folder structure during your project should/ could look like.

There are just a few helpful things to keep in mind: 

* Everything in one folder
* Separation between data, analysis, outcomes, writing
* Keep your data paths relativ, especially helpful when working in a group

## Example
[Here](https://github.com/florianhartig/ResearchSkills/tree/master/Labs/ProjectOrganization/ExampleProject) we provide an exemplary folder structure with some simulated data, basic analysis and plotting, and the implementation of these results in a LaTeX document.
You may download our example from [here](https://github.com/florianhartig/ResearchSkills/blob/master/Labs/ProjectOrganization/ExampleProject.rar) and use it as a template for your own little research project.
