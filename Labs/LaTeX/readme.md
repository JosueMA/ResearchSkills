# LaTeX

LaTeX is a script based typesetting program that allows you to set the design of your report, article, book
or whatever written statement via written commands. 
The information below provides some help to get started with LaTeX in a fairly basic way. 

## Software you need to install

* A latex distribution
  * Windows: MikTex
  * Mac: MacTex https://tug.org/mactex/
  * Linux: LaTex (often already installed)
* An editor
  * TexStudio (what we use in class)
  * TexMaker
  * ...

## Skript

This [script](https://github.com/florianhartig/ResearchSkills/blob/master/Labs/LaTeX/Script/how_to_latex.pdf) is rather a tutorial and will help you start your first document in LaTeX. You will learn how to set up your document
as a scientific article, how to include graphics and tables as well as formulae. You will learn to set up a decent
structure for your article, to easily include your citations and how to link references within your article.

## Practical

Sufficient exemplary material to setting up a first LaTeX document yourself can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/florianhartig/ResearchSkills/raw/master/Labs/LaTeX/Practical.zip).
