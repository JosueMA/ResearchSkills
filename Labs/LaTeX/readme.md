# LaTeX

LaTeX is a script based typesetting program that allows you to set the design of your report, article, book
or whatever written statement via written commands. The information below provides some help to get started with LaTeX in a fairly basic way. 

#### Install LaTeX on your computer

* A latex distribution
  * Windows: MikTex
  * Mac: MacTex https://tug.org/mactex/
  * Linux: LaTex (often already installed)
* An editor
  * TexStudio (what we use in class)
  * TexMaker
  * ...
