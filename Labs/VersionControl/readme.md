# Version control 

[Version control](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_control) systems keep a history of changes of your files and allow you to work collaboratively on files, merging changes done by different people. 

There are a lot of benefits of using such a system and virtually no costs --> all scientific code should be under version control. 

## Version control systems

### Software 

There are a few around, but basically there are two main players, subversion and Git. Git is the newer and more modern one. If you are starting with version control, start with Git!

### Providers

Although both svn and Git can be run locally, it really makes sense to have a version of your files on the web, not only as backup but also to synchronise between devices and/or collaborate with others. There are a number of web services that offer you this opportunity, partly also free. 

If you know nothing, try out GitHub, which is pretty popular in Science. See links below for how to get started with that.
