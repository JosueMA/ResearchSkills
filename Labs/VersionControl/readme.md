# Version control 

[Version control](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_control) systems keep a history of changes of your files and allow you to work collaboratively on files, merging changes done by different people. 

There are a lot of benefits of using such a system and virtually no costs --> all scientific code should be under version control. 

## Version control systems

There are a few around, but basically there are two main players, subversion and Git. Git is the newer and more modern one. If you are starting with version control, start with Git!

## Git 

Git is a distributed version control system, and it is the one that is currently the most popular. A simple tutorial / intro to Git is this here

Although Git (as svn as well) can be purely run locally, it really makes sense to have a version of your files on the web, not only as backup. If you know nothing, try out GitHub, which is pretty popular in Science. See links below for how to get started with that. Tutorials specially for GitHub (a lot applies to Git as well)
