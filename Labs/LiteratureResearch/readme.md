# Literature research

The information below provides an overview of how to search for and organize relevant literature.

An exercise demonstrating this workflow is provided in the [practical](https://github.com/florianhartig/ResearchSkills/blob/master/Labs/LiteratureResearch/Practical/Practical_LiteratureResearch.pdf).

## Scientific literature databases

The main databases are

* Google scholar https://scholar.google.de/ (free, fast)
* ISI web of knowledge http://webofknowledge.com/ (proprietory, slow, but most "official")
* Scopus http://www.scopus.com/ (proprietory, competitor to ISI)

see comments in the lecture notes / scripts about their use, in particular about how to use advanced search patterns and how they index the papers.

## Reference Managers

There are lots of reference managers, see overview [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_reference_management_software) 

You should see what is best for you. I recommend to start with 

* LaTeX - Jabref (bibtex-based)
* Word - Endnote (costly), Zotero, Mendeley, Jabref (integreation in Word tricky, some comments below)
* Open Office - Jabref, Zotero, Mendeley


### Using BibTex with Microsoft Word

From http://www.ademcan.net/?d=2012/01/30/15/23/05-using-jabref-references-in-word-documents

The following steps will help you to use your JabRef bibliography into Word documents:

1 - Export your JabRef bibliography in xml format
2 - Name the file Sources.xml
3 - Locate the original Sources.xm file at ~/Documents/Microsoft User Data in Mac (it should be something similar in Windows and Linux)
4 - Rename the Sources.xml file to Sources_Backup.xml
5 - Move the Sources.xml file from JabRef to ~/Documents/Microsoft User Data
6 - Enjoy your new bibliography in Word

Alternatives: 

* use the Bibtex4Word plugin http://www.ee.ic.ac.uk/hp/staff/dmb/perl/
* use http://www.docear.org/software/add-ons/docear4word/download/
